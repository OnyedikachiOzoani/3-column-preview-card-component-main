# Challenge description

The major purpose of this challenge is to build out the 3-column-preview-card-component, as much as possible, as the design preview for both the mobile and desktop designs respectively.

## Solution description

I've built the project to look exactly as the design preview.  
For the _mobile design_, I've set it to be visible when the **viewport width is <400px**.  
For the _desktop design_, I've set it to be visible when the **viewport width is >=400px**.

## Basic tools used

-   HTML
-   CSS

## Notable CSS properties used

-   For both the Mobile and Desktop design:
    -   Flexbox Layout

## Issues faced when building the project

The challenge was pretty easy to build. The only part that took me a little more time was making the texts in the paragraphs `.car-advert p`, wrap as in the deign preview.
